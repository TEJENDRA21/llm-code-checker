**LLM Code Checker**

LLM Code Checker is a Python-based tool that leverages OpenAI's Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python code for potential issues, best practices, and suggestions. This tool is containerized with Docker to ensure ease of deployment and reproducibility, and it can also serve results via a simple web interface.

**Features**
    
    1.LLM-Powered Code Analysis: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to review Python code.
    2.Dockerized Environment: Ensures the application runs consistently across different environments.
    3.Web Interface: Displays LLM output on a simple webpage using Flask.
    4.Git Integration: Can be adapted for pre-commit hooks to analyze staged Python files.

**Getting Started**

**1.Prerequisites**
    
    1.OpenAI API Key: You need an API key to use OpenAI services. Sign up at OpenAI.
    2.Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. Download it here.

**2.Installation**
    
    Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-code-checker.git
        cd llm-code-checker

    Build the Docker image:
        docker build -t llm-code-checker .

    Run the Docker container:
        docker run --rm -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" -p 5000:5000 llm-code-checker

**3.Usage**
Local Testing
   By default, the script analyzes a sample Python function and returns insights from the LLM.

Web Interface
    Access the web interface by navigating to http://localhost:5000 (or http://<your-ip>:5000 if running remotely).
    View the LLM's analysis of the sample Python code.
